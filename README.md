# L3APPS

Note in order for the app to run properly the gateway has to be ran from the same machine as the server
[API GATEWAY](https://github.com/Mike97M/A3-api-gateway/tree/master/demo)

A task schedular app that allows you to create and assign tasks kindof like a jyra. The biggest diference from the jyra example is the fact that the app is being able to assign automatically the tasks for the day using a set of preferences the user can define in the profile page.

The app Ui is made in React using React's semantic ui module.
